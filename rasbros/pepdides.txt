Yes, it's just not as efficient as Bruno's, because it launches another program, unnecessarily.
If efficiency matters, do it Bruno's way. I remember my way because you can use it with other
commands, where the "redirect in from" syntax doesn't work. – Warren Young Oct 5 '09 at 18:12
There's another, more serious problem with this: because the while loop is part of a pipeline,
it runs in a subshell, and hence any variables set inside the loop are lost when it exits
(see bash-hackers.org/wiki/doku.php/mirroring/bashfaq/024).
This can be very annoying (depending on what you're trying to do in the loop)

I use "cat file | " as the start of a lot of my commands purely
because I often prototype with "head file |" – mat kelcey Feb 26 '14 at 21:33
This may be not that efficient, but it's much more readable than other answers.
